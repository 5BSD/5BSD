# Development checkpoint — 2026-10-27

## Scope and resume point

This checkpoint preserves the accumulated runtime, build/packaging, and native
Bazel work on `dev`. It is not a release qualification. Make remains the
production build path and remains supported for ports. BIP is out of scope.
No host installation, upgrade, or reboot was performed for this checkpoint.

The current component, `sbin/dhclient`, has completed its normal program and
installation comparison against Make. The native graph uses explicit C sources,
headers, dependency ordering, and DTrace generation. The comparison covers 168
defined globals, 11 installation records, seven nonbinary payloads, debuglink,
and DTrace schema and probe sites (allowing relocation of code addresses).
The program was not started against a network.

Evidence is retained under `/usr/obj/usr/src/bazel-dhclient-r2-20261027` and
`/usr/obj/usr/src/bazel-dhclient-make-20261027`. The archive SHA-256 is
`8f211925595878b2c6181110d7b4d6dac6d72752e8ad41a5ed1f189ef57133ef`.
The Bazel README and observability audit contain the detailed component record.
Dhclient tests, static/rescue variants, option coverage, cache/performance
qualification, and live network behavior remain to be completed.

## Remaining migration work

There are 1,058 BUILD.bazel files at this checkpoint; this is a graph-file count,
not a count of successfully qualified products or a completion percentage.
A complete native world, kernel/modules, bootstrap, pkgbase, and image build
has not yet been demonstrated. The current component builds still consume a
Make-prepared SDK. Continue native conversion and artifact/install comparisons,
carry DTrace/FIDL generators and configuration choices into explicit actions,
and maintain the observability audit. Full configuration, sandbox/cache,
runtime, packaging, and CPU/memory/disk performance qualification remain gates.
Build frontend, backend helpers, tests, and documentation must continue to be
updated together whenever their inputs or contracts change.

## Checkpoint checks and limits

- Parsed 415 changed/untracked Python files successfully.
- Shell syntax checks passed for 68 changed/untracked shell files.
- Archive-policy tests: seven passed.
- Component-plan tests: nine passed.
- Tracked-diff whitespace check passed after correcting four trailing-space lines.
- Staging also checked newly added files: cleaned Bazel source whitespace;
  retained significant whitespace in expected-output fixtures, pkg-config
  templates, and patch context. Runtime checkpoint has two harmless EOF
  blank-line warnings.

These checks supplement existing component evidence; they do not establish
runtime correctness of every accumulated change. This commit cleanup did not
rerun the complete regression suite or boot an image.

The original tracked patch, untracked archive, status, and HEAD are saved in
`/usr/obj/usr/src/dev-checkpoint-20261027`. A stray 64-byte ELF fixture at the
source root was moved there as `stray-kernel-fixture`, rather than committed.
Intentional binary and expected-output test fixtures are retained in source.
Private-key markers examined in tests contain malformed dummy input, not keys.

## Subsequent progress: dhclient tests

The native parser test now passes, and the combined program/test installation
matches Make (20 records, nine nonbinary payloads, two debug links). Test ELF
symbols and dynamic metadata also match. See the Bazel README for evidence and
remaining PCP/VNET, configuration, and performance qualification work.

## Subsequent progress: GEOM Gate

Native ggatec, ggated, and ggatel now build through the maintained frontend and
match Make binary/install comparisons. The aggregate archive has ten records.
The Bazel README records evidence, incremental-link observation, and remaining
privileged I/O/static/platform qualification. No disk was attached or exported.

## Subsequent progress: dnctl

Native program and combined test installation match Make (13 records).
Flow-layout ABI test passes. The complete four-case native suite is defined;
three shell cases fail before their bodies in dirname because of the documented
older-host/newer-source Capsicum mismatch. Preserve these failures and rerun on
a matching kernel. The Bazel README records separate artifact and runtime evidence.

## Subsequent progress: HAST

Native hastd/hastctl program artifacts and installation match Make. Parser
header matches bytewise; parser/lexer C match apart from line-directive filenames.
The libmd consumer CcInfo target is public. Privileged daemon tests, test
installation, option/static variants, and replication performance remain next
qualification work; no daemon or replication operation was started.

## Subsequent progress: HAST test installation and option parity

HAST test packaging now matches Make (eight combined records). Both programs
also match Make with INET6_SUPPORT disabled. That setting removes the compiler
define but leaves these program artifacts unchanged: current source selects
IPv6 support at runtime. Privileged ctl runtime execution remains outstanding;
test installation must not be counted as execution.

## Subsequent progress: ping

Native default ping program and six installation records match Make, including
conditional ping6 links and setuid archive metadata. No installation or packet
transmission occurred. Checksum/ATF/pytest tests, test packaging, configuration
variants and network/runtime qualification remain outstanding.

## Subsequent progress: ping tests

Four native checksum cases execute successfully. Full program/test installation
matches Make across 21 records, including shell/pytest wrappers and fixtures.
Checksum binary metadata also matches. Shell/pytest network runtime execution,
configuration variants and performance remain outstanding.

## Subsequent progress: ping configuration qualification

IPv4-only and IPv6-only component builds now match separate Make references.
The tests-disabled full archive is byte-identical to the qualified program-only
archive. Network/injection runtime, static/rescue, other architectures and
performance remain outstanding. Next unconverted sbin areas include init with
its embedded reroot_seed, pfctl, resolvconf and veriexec.

## Subsequent progress: init prerequisite

Native static reroot_seed and its debug-split internal payload match Make's
symbols/link metadata and payload size. No standalone installation target is
created. Init still needs declared assembly embedding of that payload, binary
and configuration installation, and runtime qualification. The helper was not
executed. See the Bazel README for evidence and SDK/bootstrap limitations.

## Subsequent progress: native init

Init now builds with declared seed embedding and matches Make's symbol/link and
six-record install metadata checks, including schg. Raw assembly revealed and
fixed a missing SDK assembler input declaration; a fresh SDK receipt is under
bazel-assembly-sdk-20261027. Embedded payload bytes match the native dependency.
Make's separate object-tree seed differs, so no whole-binary identity is claimed.
Boot/root-transition/rescue behavior, changed-payload invalidation and performance
remain outstanding. No lifecycle operation was run.

## Subsequent progress: resolvconf

Native template generation and installation match Make (11 records, nine
payloads); seven shell syntax checks pass. Resolver runtime, subscriber service
integration and nondefault layout qualification remain outstanding. No resolver
state or service was changed. Remaining sbin program gaps include pfctl and
veriexec plus directory-level test aggregation.

## Subsequent progress: pfctl

Native program/parser and five-record installation match Make. Explicit
compatibility and shadow headers preserve the maintained OpenBSD/5BSD build.
The changerule helper, shell/corpus packaging, jail/VNET execution and runtime
qualification remain outstanding. Veriexec and directory-level test aggregation
remain sbin graph gaps; no firewall state was changed.

## Subsequent progress: pfctl regression packaging

Changerule now builds natively and matches Make's binary metadata. Full
program/test/corpus packaging matches 585 records and 574 nonbinary payloads.
Jail/VNET requirements remain in Kyuafile; no test or firewall control helper
was executed. Runtime corpus execution remains outstanding.

## Subsequent progress: libveriexec

Native static/shared libraries and eight installation records match Make.
BearSSL and secureboot with explicit trust inputs remain missing dependencies
before the static veriexec command can be built natively. Kernel interaction,
script execution and enforcement runtime qualification remain outstanding.

## Subsequent progress: BearSSL and commit checkpoint

Native default BearSSL static/shared libraries and installation now match Make:
186 archive members, 19 installation records and 13 identical headers. Explicit
optional SSL sources and a format-5 selector are declared but that variant and
upstream crypto runtime tests remain unqualified. Evidence and exact checks are
recorded in the Bazel README.

Resume with BearSSL SSL/runtime qualification and the secureboot library's
explicit trust-generation inputs, then the static veriexec consumer. Broader
world/kernel/module conversion, native bootstrap, complete pkgbase/frontend
integration, configuration coverage and cache/performance qualification remain.
Make remains the production/default backend and the ports build system; the
current SDK is still Make-prepared. BIP remains dropped. This commit checkpoint
records a component milestone, not completion of the system migration.

## Subsequent progress: optional BearSSL and crypto tests

The full upstream crypto suite now passes as a native Bazel test with SSL
enabled; five Power8 cases remain unavailable on this amd64 host. Qualification
found and repaired 26 missing optional sources in both Make and Bazel. The
295-member optional library and all 19 installation records match the explicit
Make reference. See README for preserved failures and final evidence.

Next: explicit secureboot trust-generation inputs and the veriexec consumer.
TLS network/X.509 fixture coverage, broader configuration and performance gates
remain outstanding. All earlier system-wide migration limitations still apply.

## Subsequent progress: explicit secureboot header generation

A declared Bazel rule now generates trust/configuration headers from explicit
policy and certificate inputs. Native generated-header execution passes; 35
host reference/rejection checks pass. The fixture deliberately trusts nobody.
This does not yet build libsecureboot or establish signed-file/boot enforcement.
Next connect the generator through a configurable library graph, qualify real
certificate inputs and Make parity, then build the veriexec consumer. See README
for evidence, interface scope and unqualified cases.

## Subsequent progress: native libsecureboot static graph

Eight-source native static library now builds with explicitly selected trust
policy and certificate labels. An upstream public fixture decodes into one
anchor and cached initialization succeeds. Archive member/symbol counts match
Make (eight/41); missing policy fails analysis. No default production trust is
introduced. Shared installation, real signed-file checks, key rotation and
veriexec consumer conversion remain next steps. The audit log records an
existing hash self-test return-status weakness found during review.

## Subsequent progress: native veriexec command

Static veriexec and its maintained manifest test build natively. Four parser
cases pass using the existing test ioctl recorder; all 12 program/test install
records and binary symbol/static-link checks match Make. Evidence and reference
library selection are documented in the README. No host enforcement operation
was run. Continue with libsecureboot shared installation and signed-file/trust
rotation qualification, including the recorded self-test return-status issue.
System-wide world/kernel/package/bootstrap and performance gates remain open.

## Subsequent progress: libsecureboot shared installation

Shared library and all seven installation records now match Make. Both build
systems explicitly link BearSSL; its previously missing shared dependency is
fixed along with Make's transitive dependency metadata. Static and shared
trust-initialization tests pass. The SDK receipt was regenerated through maintained
helpers under bazel-secureboot-sdk-20261027 after the metadata change.
Next: signed-file/key-rotation qualification and the recorded hash self-test
error-propagation issue. System-wide migration and performance gates remain open.
